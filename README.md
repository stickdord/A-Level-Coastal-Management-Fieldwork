# Coastal Management Fieldwork Investigation

## Aims
This fieldwork project aims to investigate the effectiveness of coastal management strategies at the Holderness Coast, Yorkshire.

## Hypotheses
1. Hard engineering structures (groynes, sea walls) are more effective at reducing erosion than soft engineering approaches.
2. Managed retreat areas show higher ecological value but lower economic protection.

## Location
The study site is the Holderness Coast, Yorkshire, focusing on three key management types: groynes, sea walls, and managed retreat areas.

## Methodology
Data collection will involve primary field measurements at selected sites, including groyne height, wave frequency counts, and bi-polar effectiveness scoring (1-5 scale). Secondary data will include historical erosion rates and cost-benefit analysis.

## Expected Outcomes
A comprehensive analysis of coastal management effectiveness to inform future policy decisions and provide students with practical fieldwork experience.
