# GitHub Workflow for Fieldwork Collaboration

This repository demonstrates a modern, collaborative approach to managing an A-Level geography fieldwork investigation using GitHub.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Project Setup**
   - Created repository with README outlining project aims, hypotheses, and location.
   - Established project planning tasks using file-based issue tracking (due to tool limitations).

2. **Data Collection & Submission**
   - Student Group 1 created a feature branch `data-submission-group-1`.
   - Added field data CSV file with measurements of groyne height, wave counts, and effectiveness scores.
   - Opened a Pull Request for teacher review.

3. **Teacher Review & Feedback**
   - Teacher reviewed the data submission via PR comments.
   - Provided constructive feedback on data quality and reporting expectations.
   - Approved the PR for merging.

4. **Integration & Version Control**
   - PR merged using squash merge to keep commit history clean.
   - Data file now resides in the main branch, forming part of the master dataset.
   - Commit history provides a transparent, time‑stamped log of the project’s progress.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Version Control**: Students learn to work with branches, commits, and merges.
- **Collaboration**: Clear separation of roles (teacher sets up tasks, students submit work) and a structured review process.
- **Transparency**: Every change is recorded, making it easy to trace decisions and data origins.
- **Real‑World Skills**: The workflow mirrors how research groups and open‑source projects operate, preparing students for higher education and modern workplaces.

## Adapting the Template

This workflow can be reused for any fieldwork topic by:
- Updating the README with new aims/hypotheses.
- Creating new branch‑based submissions for each student group.
- Using the same review and merge process to build a comprehensive dataset.
